                <h2>On the Subject of Flashing Circles</h2>
                <p class="flavour-text">Circles are a bizarre choice for this disco mat, to be honest.</p>
                <p>The module contains a grid of 36 circles and two start buttons, one in red and one in blue, along the right.</p>
                <p>When either start button is pressed, the circles will all flash different colour sequences consisting of 10 flashes, apart from two, which will flash an identical sequence of colours.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>When the red button is pressed, all circles will be active, with each flash be one of 6 colours, Red, Green, Blue, Cyan, Magenta, or Yellow.</li>
                <li>When the blue button is pressed, only the middle 4 by 4 grid of circles will be active, with each flash be one of 3 colours, Red, Green, or Blue.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In either set of sequences, select the 2 circles which are flashing the same sequence, based on the latest start button press, to solve the module.</p>
                <p>You may press either button as many times as you want without penalty. However, after a circle selection, the button other than the latest pressed one will not play its own set.</p>
                <p>Of course, a strike will incur for a wrong circle selection, but will not reset the module.</p>
